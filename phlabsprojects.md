					<p>Here are some recent projects by Ph Labs.</p>

			<h2 class="phlabs">New: International Council for Archaeozoology</h2>

				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://alexandriaarchive.org/icaz/index.htm">alexandriaarchive.org/icaz/index.htm</a></p>

				<p>A site redesign for the International Council for Archaeozoology (ICAZ) is scheduled for next year in preparation for the organization's upcoming conference in September 2014.</p>


			<h2 class="phlabs">Ongoing: Open Context</h2>

				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://opencontext.org">opencontext.org</a></p>

				<p>Redesigning the usability of the Open Context project is an ongoing collaboration for Ph Labs.  The first iteration (in 2012) included a design facelift that updated the logo, color palate, and main navigation of the website as a part of the redesign of Open Context's parent organization website, <a target="_blank" href="http://alexandriaarchive.org">alexandriaarchive.org</a>.  Another early iteration included collaborating on user research with <a target="_blank" href="http://dipir.org">DIPIR</a> at the University of Michigan School of Information.  This research placed the Open Context project in the more general setting of data collection and reuse in the social and biological sciences.  Current design work (2013) includes a collaboration with Chris Blow of <a target="_blank" href="http://unthinkingly.com">Unthinkingly</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://meedan.org">Meedan</a> to supply a style guide for the Open Context website, as well as feedback on the technical and conceptual implementation of the homepage map and timeline.  Future design work will include executing a user research study, integrating user research feedback, and honing the website's architecture and page layout.  Check back in the future for updates.</p>



			<h2 class="phlabs">Making of Ancient Eurasia Project</h2>
			
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://mae.uchicago.edu">mae.uchicao.edu</a></p>

				<p>Ph Labs designed and built a custom website to display MAE's research online.  A collaboration between faculty and students in the Anthropology Department at the University of Chicago and Argon National Laboratory in Aurora, Illinois, MAE needed a website that would allow them to provide resources — such as references, images, and access to their wiki — to both fellow team members and to the larger research community.  Design decisions on this project were motivated primarily by MAE's desire to create a site that would convey a professional image to outside members of the scientific research community.  Because their main audience consists of other researchers, and because they plan for their body of research resources to grow over time, they chose a minimalist design that could undergo multiple iterations of adding more content without additional technical support or development overhead.</p>



			<h2 class="phlabs">InSTEDD iLab Southeast Asia</h2>
			
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ilabsea.instedd.org">ilabsea.instedd.org</a></p>

			<p>Phoebe France and Chris Blow first worked with the InSTEDD iLab Southeast Asia in June 2009 to help them address usability concerns in their GeoChat software, and to build capacity in the realm of user interface design and user research testing for public health tools.  InSTEDD invited Phoebe back to Phnom Penh in Feb — March of 2012 to help the development team create an English-language blog.  The goals of this blog were to provide a venue for publishing and promoting recent technological developments, and to tell the human story behind the creation of their tools.  Phoebe's relationship with the Phnom Penh team is ongoing, and she plans to return to Cambodia in the near future to continue her collaboration with them.</p>



			<h2 class="phlabs">Alexandria Archive Institute</h2>
			
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://alexandriaarchive.org">alexandriaarchive.org</a></p>

				<p>Ph Labs redesigned the website and blog for the Alexandria Archive Institute to update their look and feel so that it is professional, modern, and scholarly.  The design and information architecture take into account that their primary audiences are both funding agencies and individual researchers looking into the possibility of contributing data to the Open Context project.  The redesign of the AAI website and blog also took into consideration that AAI is the parent organization of both the online data publication website Open Context, as well as the Society for American Archaeology blog Heritage Bytes.  New logos for all three sites and the overall designs were initiated together to better define the relationships between the organizations and to create a unified identity for the three projects.</p>




			<h2 class="phlabs">EurASEAA 14 Conference, Dublin</h2>
			
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucd.ie/archaeology/euraseaa14/index.html">ucd.ie/archaeology/euraseaa14/index.html</a></p>

				<p>In this project, Ph Labs created a brochure site for the EurASEAA Conference.   Building upon the layout of the website for the EurASEAA 13 Conference from 2010, the 2012 website integrates a lively color scheme with images from real archaeological research projects across Southeast Asia.  In addition, the EurASEAA 14 site was coded to semantic web standards so that the organization could reuse the basic framework of the website for future conferences with minimal technical support and costs.</p>




			<h2 class="phlabs">Nuclear Philosopher</h2>
			
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://nuclearphilosopher.org">nuclearphilosopher.org</a></p>

				<p>This project is the website of writer and researcher Anne I. Harrington.  After completing her Ph.D. and moving on to the academic job market, Harrington wanted a website that would help her update her professional image and present her research to broader readership.  Working closely together, she and Ph Labs came up with a design and architecture that was at once personal and professional.  It is a clean design that can be scanned quickly for content, and leaves readers with a clear sense of her range of research expertise and her leadership and teaching skills.  It also requires minimal technical support to update the content.</p>




			<h2 class="phlabs">deAppropriation Project Archive</h2>
			
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://deappropriationproject.org">deappropriationproject.org</a></p>

				<p>Artist and architect Bruce Tomb first hired Ph Labs to build an online archive of digital images of street art taken at his home at 1240 Valencia Street in the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco.  After being invited to participate in the Mission Muralismo project later that year, we continued our collaboration to create a time-lapse slideshow video of digital images taken over the course of nearly a decade.  To display the slideshow, Ph Labs designed a new page for the existing website, as well as recoded the entire website to semantic web standards in order to facilitate easier implementation of future updates and additions.</p>
